## Usage

### login

Enter and store Amazon AWS credentials. The credentials will be stored in a file called .in-deploy-user in the directory where you run the in-deploy executable. You have to run the executable from the same directory if you want to use the credentials later. Make sure you don't commit the credentials file to a public source code repository.

```
$ in-deploy 
Commands: login | add | push | pull | quit
? Command: login
? Region: <the region where your bucket was created>
? Access key ID: ********************
? Secret access key: ****************************************
```

### add

If you are on a build machine, use this command to register a directory with builds. If you are on a deployment machine, use this command to register a directory where you will store application archives for deployment. The mappings from application names to directories and buckets will be stored in a file called .in-deploy-app in the directory where you run the in-deploy executable. You have to run the executable from the same directory if you want to use the mappings later.

```
$ in-deploy 
Commands: login | add | push | pull | quit
? Command: add
? Name: <typically an application name>
? Directory: <directory with application archives (relative to current directory)>
? Bucket name: <name of the S3 bucket>
```

### push

Use this command to push an application archive from a build machine to an S3 bucket.

```
$ in-deploy 
Commands: login | add | push | pull | quit
? Command: push
? Name: <typically an application name>
? File: SomeApplication-x.y.z.zip
Upload <full path>/SomeApplication-x.y.z.zip to <bucket name>
ETag: "********************************"
```

### pull

Use this command to pull an application archive from an S3 bucket to a deployment machine.

```
$ in-deploy 
Commands: login | add | push | pull | quit
? Command: pull
? Name: <typically an application name>
? File: 
‚ùØ SomeApplication-x.y.z.zip
